We examine the 10-year long partnership between the Museum and local K\u201312 schools with large Latino\/Hispanic populations as mediated by Emory University\u2019s faculty and staff most recently located within the Center for Community Partnerships. We contend that programs in the MCCM facilitated by the education department could be used as a model going forward that demonstrates multiple shifts and transformations in the role of the campus museum and its relationship both with the university and with the community. We present possibilities for the MCCM and other museums at institutions that aspire to be \u201cengaged campuses\u201d to more fully align their missions with that goal.<\/p>","galleys":[{"galleyId":"12","label":"hartfield_1stpages","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/16\/12"}],"references":null,"files":[{"suppFileId":"25","fileId":"52","title":"Emory and MCCM_Latino Youth Leadership Conference 2012_Students in galleries","subject":"","creator":"Vialla Hartfield-M\u00e9ndez","description":"","type":"Media asset (e.g., image, movie, sound file, etc.)","typeOther":{"en_US":"image"},"language":"","publisher":"","sponsor":"","source":"","dateCreated":"2013-06-04","sequence":"0","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/downloadSuppFile\/16\/25","localization":{"title":{"en_US":"Emory and MCCM_Latino Youth Leadership Conference 2012_Students in galleries"},"subject":{"en_US":""},"creator":{"en_US":"Vialla Hartfield-M\u00e9ndez"},"publisher":{"en_US":""},"sponsor":{"en_US":""},"source":{"en_US":""},"description":{"en_US":""}}}],"authorString":"Vialla Hartfield-M\u00e9ndez, Meghan Tierney","authors":[{"authorId":"18","primary":true,"firstName":"Vialla","middleName":"","lastName":"Hartfield-M\u00e9ndez","sequence":"1","country":"US","email":"vhartfi@emory.edu","url":"","biography":"<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: '\uff2d\uff33 \u660e\u671d'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">Vialla Hartfield-M\u00e9ndez<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; mso-fareast-font-family: '\uff2d\uff33 \u660e\u671d'; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-fareast; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\"> holds a PhD in Spanish literature from the University of Virginia.

In 2007, a civic agency commissioned renowned artist Fred Wilson to create <em>E Pluribus Unum<\/em>, a piece of public art for the Indianapolis Cultural Trail. Four years later, after extensive public controversy about issues of race, power, history and representation, the commissioning agency cancelled Wilson\u2019s commission. Faculty members organized the symposium to focus on issues of art, race, and space, concepts which were foundational to the controversy. They drew inspiration from practices of engaged dialogue developed at museums and historic sites. Instead of a traditional academic symposium, the organizers created a hybrid event that combined university and community resources, expertise, and communication practices and brought together diverse voices in constructive conversation about the challenging issues surrounding <em>E Pluribus Unum<\/em>.<\/p>"}}},{"id":"8","publishedArticleId":"15","issueId":"2","journalId":"1","datePublished":"2017-07-19 20:51:25","dateSubmitted":"2013-06-03 07:39:09","sequence":"6","locale":"en_US","language":"en","title":"Interview with Bill Aguado","cleanTitle":"Interview with Bill Aguado","subject":"arts; social justice; independent artists; community action and revitalization","subjectClass":"Theater; Art; Education","coverageGeo":"","coverageChron":"","discipline":{"en_US":"theater"},"sectionId":"1","sectionTitle":"Principles and Practices","sectionAbbrev":"FEA","sponsor":"","abstract":"<span>In Kevin Bott\u2019s interview,<strong> <\/strong>Bill Aguado, director for 30 years of the Bronx Council on the Arts, asserts the importance of including the independent artist in Imagining America\u2019s thinking and planning.
