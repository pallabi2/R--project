From our position as participants, the authors consider the engagement ideals of community-based theatre and analyze the Circle\u2019s attempts to use pedagogy and scholarship to engage new academic communities in dialogue, some of whom were geographically removed from the performance location. The challenges we encountered point to an ongoing challenge in community-based, popular, and publically-engaged art: the emphasis on dialogue, while central to the ethos of the work, can make engaging new participants and reaching new audiences\/communities difficult. The authors recount their experiences in the collaborative process, observing that dialogic relationships need contact, inclusion, and time to germinate, emerge, and develop. Despite these challenges, this experience reinforces the artistic, pedagogical, and scholarly value of dialogue and engagement with community-based artistic projects.\u00a0<\/p>","galleys":[{"galleyId":"87","label":"190","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/190\/87"},{"galleyId":"97","label":"HTML: 1st pages","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/190\/97"}],"references":"Works Cited\r\nArmstrong, Ann Elizabeth. 2000. \u201cParadoxes in Community-Based Pedagogy: \r\nDecentering Students through Oral History Performance.\u201d Theatre Topics 10.2: 113-128.

From our position as participants, the authors consider the engagement ideals of community-based theatre and analyze the Circle\u2019s attempts to use pedagogy and scholarship to engage new academic communities in dialogue, some of whom were geographically removed from the performance location. The challenges we encountered point to an ongoing challenge in community-based, popular, and publically-engaged art: the emphasis on dialogue, while central to the ethos of the work, can make engaging new participants and reaching new audiences\/communities difficult. The authors recount their experiences in the collaborative process, observing that dialogic relationships need contact, inclusion, and time to germinate, emerge, and develop. Despite these challenges, this experience reinforces the artistic, pedagogical, and scholarly value of dialogue and engagement with community-based artistic projects.\u00a0<\/p>"}}},{"id":"169","publishedArticleId":"87","issueId":"9","journalId":"1","datePublished":"2017-12-07 20:04:07","dateSubmitted":"2015-09-15 14:15:00","sequence":"3","locale":"en_US","language":"en","title":"Creative Justice: Arts Education for the City","cleanTitle":"Creative Justice: Arts Education for the City","subject":"arts education, community development, urban design, transportation planning, safe routes to school, sustainability, youth development, participatory research, STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math)","subjectClass":"arts education, community development, urban design, transportation planning, sustainability, youth development, participatory research","coverageGeo":"East Los Angeles, California, Los Angeles","coverageChron":"2015","discipline":null,"sectionId":"3","sectionTitle":"Resources \u2028and Case Studies","sectionAbbrev":"REX","sponsor":"Exploring the Arts, CREO Worldwide,","abstract":"<p>This praxis informed essay analyzes a school-wide arts integration project with high school students in East Los Angeles that performed participatory research on Safe Routes to School (SRTS) in the neighborhood. The essay outlines a social engagement research design, conceptual framework, and case study analysis. The theoretical discussion shares philosophical ideas about social justice driven teaching and learning through the arts. The case study reveals micro-transformations that took place in classrooms committed to youth empowerment. Studying the city through the Arts allowed teenagers to amplify local knowledge, practice leadership, and envision alternative futures. Along the way, students cultivated personal and social agency as the heroes and heroines of their own stories, and learned new ways to intervene in urban systems that impact their daily lives.<\/p>","galleys":[{"galleyId":"82","label":"169","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/169\/82"},{"galleyId":"98","label":"HTML: 1st pages","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/169\/98"}],"references":"Work Cited\r\n \r\nAnzaldua, G.

The essay outlines a social engagement research design, conceptual framework, and case study analysis. The theoretical discussion shares philosophical ideas about social justice driven teaching and learning through the arts. The case study reveals micro-transformations that took place in classrooms committed to youth empowerment. Studying the city through the Arts allowed teenagers to amplify local knowledge, practice leadership, and envision alternative futures. Along the way, students cultivated personal and social agency as the heroes and heroines of their own stories, and learned new ways to intervene in urban systems that impact their daily lives.<\/p>"}}},{"id":"142","publishedArticleId":"89","issueId":"9","journalId":"1","datePublished":"2017-12-07 20:04:07","dateSubmitted":"2015-02-01 17:18:42","sequence":"1","locale":"en_US","language":"en","title":"Community Matters Book Review","cleanTitle":"Community Matters Book Review","subject":"Engaged Design, Service Learning, Design,","subjectClass":"Landscape Architecture, Architecture, Planning","coverageGeo":"","coverageChron":"","discipline":null,"sectionId":"2","sectionTitle":"Reviews","sectionAbbrev":"REV","sponsor":"","abstract":"","galleys":[{"galleyId":"81","label":"142","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/142\/81"},{"galleyId":"99","label":"HTML: 1st pages","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/142\/99"}],"references":"","files":[],"authorString":"Richard Alomar","authors":[{"authorId":"229","primary":true,"firstName":"Richard","middleName":"","lastName":"Alomar","sequence":"1","country":"US","email":"richard.alomar@rutgers.edu","url":"","biography":"<p><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">Richard Alomar is an assistant professor of landscape architecture and extension specialist at Rutgers University.
