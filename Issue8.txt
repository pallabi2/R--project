Witt directs an arts-integrated curriculum at a school for teenage refugee girls in Decatur, GA. Torres-Tama uses performance, visual arts, bilingual poetry, critical writings, and the development of a mobile <em>teatro <\/em>to ensure that the enormous contributions Latina\/o immigrants made to New Orleans\u2019 post-Katrina reconstruction are not forgotten. Both projects bear witness to immigrant experiences in the South, resisting and complicating the polemic black\/white struggle that has long defined the region and the nation\u2019s racial paradigm. Positioning their work within the context of European colonization, cross-Atlantic slave trade, and late-twentieth-century US imperialism, these artists reveal the ways in which global conflict and resistance to it has been, and continues to be, woven into the fabric of the South. As artists, their work not only illuminates these issues, but also underscores the power and value of engaging with them through the arts.<\/p>","galleys":[],"references":"Baldwin, James. 1985.

Its results and significance go far beyond the local context. The ideas, attitudes, and cultural practices developed by Krzysztof Czy\u017cewski, the Borderland founder, are organized into an original philosophy of the \u201cculture of remembering.\u201d By rejecting oblivion as a method of neutralizing the demons of the past and by analyzing the mechanism of forgetting, Czy\u017cewski declares himself for a \u201ccultural archaeology of memory,\u201d which is based on painstaking, lengthy, everyday work with people. The culture of remembrance practiced in this way not only builds social ties and cultural identity, but also inspires artistic exploration and new forms of expression. Memory becomes an authentic part of everyday experience.<\/p>"}}},{"id":"184","publishedArticleId":"74","issueId":"8","journalId":"1","datePublished":"2015-11-02 05:36:58","dateSubmitted":"2015-11-01 17:40:57","sequence":"4","locale":"en_US","language":"en","title":"Reflected Borderlands \u2013 Newark\/Sejny: The Borderland Center, the Urban Civic Initiative, and the \u201cMy Story\u201d Project at Rutgers University-Newark","cleanTitle":"Reflected Borderlands \u2013 Newark\/Sejny: The Borderland Center the Urban Civic Initiative and the \u201cMy Story\u201d Project at Rutgers UniversityNewark","subject":"social justice; performance; education; workshop","subjectClass":"Arts Activism; Community Development;Education;Theater","coverageGeo":"Newark, New Jersey; Warsaw, Poland; Sejny, Poland","coverageChron":"","discipline":null,"sectionId":"1","sectionTitle":"Principles and Practices","sectionAbbrev":"FEA","sponsor":"","abstract":"<p>\"Reflected Borderlands\" examines the influence of the Borderland Center, a Polish-based, internationally recognized NGO whose work focuses on engaging arts-based strategies to address issues of ethno-national conflict, on a recent community-engaged initiative developed by the Department of Arts, Culture and Media (ACM) at Rutgers University-Newark (RU-N).

The paper builds from a literature review of cross-cultural competencies focusing on specific metrics. The case study reflects the lessons learned by adopting cross-cultural design education tools, and shifting from formal and instructor-led to informal and student-driven educational experiences, These approaches are derived from methods for building cross-cultural competence in order to enhance collaboration between US faculty and students and Ghanaians. The tools used range from <em>transferring<\/em> information gained about Ghanaian culture, to <em>translating<\/em> that information into knowledge through various interactions with Ghanaians, to <em>transforming<\/em> that knowledge into cocreated design outcomes spanning art, design, and planning.<\/p><p>\u00a0<\/p>"}}},{"id":"132","publishedArticleId":"66","issueId":"8","journalId":"1","datePublished":"2015-06-09 17:29:30","dateSubmitted":"2015-02-01 16:35:53","sequence":"2","locale":"en_US","language":"en","title":"Design Activism in Brazil: Building Community in Pedagogy and Practice","cleanTitle":"Design Activism in Brazil: Building Community in Pedagogy and Practice","subject":"community engaged design; interior design; design; public interest design; international design; service learning; social activism;","subjectClass":"design; community development","coverageGeo":"Sao Paulo, Brazil, South America","coverageChron":"2013","discipline":null,"sectionId":"3","sectionTitle":"Resources \u2028and Case Studies","sectionAbbrev":"REX","sponsor":"University of Kentucky, College of Design","abstract":"<p class=\"BODY\"><strong><\/strong>The University of Kentucky Summer Study Abroad Program in Brazil is a suite of collaborative courses that explore socially responsible design as a means of engaging stakeholders in shaping their environment and, in the process, building community.

This paper offers a case study of a self-organized senior club, \u201cSweet Home,\u201d in Shanghai, whose residents collaborated with design students and faculty in 2012. We present four design projects that reflect the different design research methods we applied to the co-creation process. We also discuss the results of the evaluation we conducted. Through the project, we found that design could be an amplifier of local ingenuity and thus promote the quality of the community environment.
