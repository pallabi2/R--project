This article proposes to examine a working partnership that has developed over three years at the University of California Berkeley, between an instructor at the university, Patricia Steenland, and the Owens Valley Paiute tribal elder and water activist Harry Williams. Williams' work has sparked students' imagination and led to major research projects, including a documentary film. Since then the partnership has become a collaborative project, involving also the exciting exploration of archival documents at Berkeley's Bancroft Library related to Paiute history. Students involved in research projects help to restore the archival memory of traditions and texts lost to the Paiute over time. The collaborative project now involves not only Steenland and Williams, but also students and Bancroft curators.","galleys":[{"galleyId":"25","label":"html","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/105\/25"},{"galleyId":"37","label":"HTML_2ndPages","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/105\/37"},{"galleyId":"49","label":"HTML_3rdPages","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/105\/49"}],"references":"Bauer, William J. 2012. \"The Giant and the Waterbaby.\" Boom: A Journal of California 2 (4). http:\/\/www.boomcalifornia.com\/2013\/03\/the-giant-and-the-waterbaby\/\r\n\r\nCavelle, Jenna. 2011. \"Recovering Cultural Memory: Irrigation Systems of the Owens Valley Paiute.\" Unpublished essay submitted as final project for CW50\/150AC: Researching Water in the West, UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\nDittmann, Caroline. 2014. \"Exploring the Bancroft Ethnographic Documents Collection: Frank Essene, Frederick Hulse, and the Paiute Ethnography Collection.\" Unpublished essay submitted as final project for CW 50\/150AC: Researching Water in the West, UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\nLawton, Harry W., Philip J.

This article proposes to examine a working partnership that has developed over three years at the University of California Berkeley, between an instructor at the university, Patricia Steenland, and the Owens Valley Paiute tribal elder and water activist Harry Williams. Williams' work has sparked students' imagination and led to major research projects, including a documentary film. Since then the partnership has become a collaborative project, involving also the exciting exploration of archival documents at Berkeley's Bancroft Library related to Paiute history. Students involved in research projects help to restore the archival memory of traditions and texts lost to the Paiute over time. The collaborative project now involves not only Steenland and Williams, but also students and Bancroft curators."}}},{"id":"97","publishedArticleId":"51","issueId":"7","journalId":"1","datePublished":"2014-12-10 10:09:06","dateSubmitted":"2014-07-15 16:15:31","sequence":"4","locale":"en_US","language":"en","title":"Citizen Stories: A New Path to Culture Change","cleanTitle":"Citizen Stories: A New Path to Culture Change","subject":"engaged pedagogy; citizen professionalism; civic engagement; interviewing; community-based research; pedagogy","subjectClass":"public humanities","coverageGeo":"Kentucky; United States","coverageChron":"21st Century","discipline":null,"sectionId":"3","sectionTitle":"Resources \u2028and Case Studies","sectionAbbrev":"REX","sponsor":"","abstract":"This article offers a case study of a citizen stories assignment implemented by the authors at Western Kentucky University in Spring 2014.

The project consisted of two parts that reinforced each other: the first part was a physical component that provided the space for the second, civic-social events; in turn, these social events provided the workforce to create and maintain the physical component. Over the course of eight weeks, various stakeholders evolved as they helped build a mural, a community bulletin board, seats, and a suggestion board.<\/p><p>The space and the project served supportive roles for the community participation that developed, reinforcing Hannah Arendt's articulation that action is not \"the beginning of something, but somebody\" (Arendt 1958, 177). Although participatory projects are prolific in American neighborhoods, there is a lack of critical public discourse. This multi-media project collage suggests a methodology by which we might understand such community actions.<\/p>"}}},{"id":"121","publishedArticleId":"55","issueId":"7","journalId":"1","datePublished":"2014-12-10 10:11:28","dateSubmitted":"2014-08-20 00:19:50","sequence":"1","locale":"en_US","language":"en","title":"Book Review of Democracy's Education: Public Work, Citizenship, and the Future of Colleges and Universities","cleanTitle":"Book Review of Democracy's Education: Public Work Citizenship and the Future of Colleges and Universities","subject":"public work; higher education","subjectClass":"education; public scholarship; public humanities","coverageGeo":"","coverageChron":"2000-2019; 21st Century","discipline":null,"sectionId":"2","sectionTitle":"Reviews","sectionAbbrev":"REV","sponsor":"","abstract":"<em><\/em>","galleys":[{"galleyId":"39","label":"HTML_2ndPages","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/121\/39"},{"galleyId":"51","label":"HTML_3rdPages","url":"https:\/\/ojstest.syr.edu\/index.php\/public\/article\/viewFile\/121\/51"}],"references":"Boyte, Harry C. 2015. ed.
