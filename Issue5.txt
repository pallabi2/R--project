The project is a twenty-first century triptych with three parallel sections. A Manifesto from the Middle Ground advances collective claims about hybrid, intermediary work and positions. Myths and Manifestations enacts a critique of the institutionalized assumptions about these positions and their work. Grounds initiates the project of collecting stories that inform the first two sections\u2014and invites reader response. While one can read the piece linearly, hyperlinked bridges also open thematic pathways through the text. We present here the insights, dilemmas, and strategies of those working in hybrid positions in order to elaborate our critical agency in social and institutional change work; to specify our knowledges and skill sets; and to inaugurate more inclusive narratives about collaborative work and knowledge production.","galleys":[],"references":"\u201cExpanding Engagement: University Staff as Agents of Social Change\u201d (roundtable convened at the annual Imagining America: Artists and Scholars in Public Life conference, New York, New York, October 6, 2012).\r\n\r\nMoraga, Cherr\u00ede and Gloria E.

The project is a twenty-first century triptych with three parallel sections. A Manifesto from the Middle Ground advances collective claims about hybrid, intermediary work and positions. Myths and Manifestations enacts a critique of the institutionalized assumptions about these positions and their work. Grounds initiates the project of collecting stories that inform the first two sections\u2014and invites reader response. While one can read the piece linearly, hyperlinked bridges also open thematic pathways through the text. We present here the insights, dilemmas, and strategies of those working in hybrid positions in order to elaborate our critical agency in social and institutional change work; to specify our knowledges and skill sets; and to inaugurate more inclusive narratives about collaborative work and knowledge production."}}},{"id":"67","publishedArticleId":"38","issueId":"5","journalId":"1","datePublished":"2014-09-01 00:00:00","dateSubmitted":"2014-01-16 18:16:43","sequence":"4","locale":"en_US","language":"en","title":"From 19th-Century Benevolence Literature to 21st-Century Activism","cleanTitle":"From 19thCentury Benevolence Literature to 21stCentury Activism","subject":"community-based learning; benevolence discourse; cultural citizenship; racialized benevolence; counternarrative","subjectClass":"African American Studies; Public Humanities; English and Textual Studies; Languages, Literature and Linguistics","coverageGeo":"Washington, DC","coverageChron":"19th century; 21st century; 1793; 1861; 1868; 1901","discipline":null,"sectionId":"1","sectionTitle":"Principles and Practices","sectionAbbrev":"FEA","sponsor":"","abstract":"<p>The author reflects on the mutually reinforcing aspects of her professional experience developing community-based learning programs in higher education and her graduate study in 19<sup>th<\/sup>-century African American \"benevolence\" literature.

The study focuses on the power relations represented by benevolent acts and social perceptions regarding benefactor and recipient roles, thus complicating the dominant American narrative of benevolence.

Engaging an inclusive range of stakeholders, it moves design from passive reaction to goals created by the wealthy and powerful to proactive empowerment of the overlooked and underrepresented. Design thus fulfills its potential to contribute to solutions to a myriad of issues connected to the built environment, such as climate change, increasing urbanization, and growing inequity between rich and poor. Present in university design centers, non-profit organizations, for-profit firms, and university courses, public interest design is providing new opportunities for students, young professionals, and all those interested in using their knowledge and training to create positive futures.\u00a0 \u00a0<\/p>","galleys":[],"references":"Aquilino, Marie, ed. 2011.
